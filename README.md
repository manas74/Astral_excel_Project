# Atliq Hardware - Business Performance Analysis
### *Problem Statement*
The main problem is to analyze the performance of Astral Adhesive's customers over the years and determine which customers had the most significant impact on sales growth from 2020 to 2021.

### *Analysis*

1. *Sales Growth*  
   The data shows significant growth for almost all customers, with some experiencing over 400% or more in sales growth. The overall sales increased from 87.5M in 2019 to 196.7M in 2020, and a massive jump to 598.9M in 2021 (304.5% total growth).

2. *Top Performers*  
   - *Amazon*, the largest customer in terms of sales, saw an increase from 37.5M in 2020 to 82.1M in 2021 (218.9% growth).
   - Other notable contributors to this growth include *Neptune* (471.5%), *Electricalsquipio Stores* (535.3%), and *Logic Stores* (515.2%).

3. *Outliers*  
   - Some smaller customers, such as *Nova*, saw extremely high growth rates, such as 2664.9%, though starting from a lower sales base.
   - Several customers like *Electricalsbea Stores, **Lotus, and **Vijay Sales* also posted growth rates around or above 400%.

4. *General Trend*  
   The data suggests that Astral Adhesive experienced rapid growth across all customer segments, with many customers more than doubling their sales between 2020 and 2021. This points to either an expansion in the product offering, market demand, or increased customer reach.
